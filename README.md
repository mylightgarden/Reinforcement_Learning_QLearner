# Q-Learning Implementation for Reinforcement Learning

This Python code implements a Q-learning algorithm for reinforcement learning. Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning technique that aims to learn a policy, which tells an agent what action to take under what circumstances.

The QLearner class includes functionalities for updating Q-values, exploring actions, and handling a simple Dyna-Q model for simulated experience. The code is designed with modularity, allowing users to customize parameters such as the number of states, actions, learning rates, and exploration probabilities.

To use the Q-learning algorithm, create an instance of the QLearner class, and interact with the environment using the `querysetstate` and `query` methods. The code is provided with optional verbosity for debugging and understanding the agent's behavior.

This implementation can serve as a foundation for experimenting with reinforcement learning tasks and understanding the Q-learning algorithm.
